## Project-specific Instructions

- Before making any file modifications, ask clarifying questions to confirm the user's intent, unless the request is direct and unambiguous (e.g., "fix the typo in file X").
- Prioritize understanding and clarification over immediate action.
- **Style & Design:**
  - The webpage design is inspired by the style of Anthropic.
  - Focus on being clean, simple, and not confusing.
  - Our style reflects a company that is dynamic and active in 2026.
  - **Photography:** Most photographs should follow the style of Yousuf Karsh—classy and simple, but powerful.
- **Blog:**
  - Our blog is hosted on Substack, and we link to it from our site.
  - **Tone & Language:** The language should be appropriate for a dynamic 2026 company: clear on the informal side, but very focused and highly insightful regarding the AI space.
  - Note: The blog's visual style is NOT under our control since it is hosted on Substack.
- **Maintenance:** Whenever the structure of a page is changed, the `sitemap.xml` must be updated.
- **Tracking & Analytics:**
  - We use Google Ads (AdWords) and Google Analytics to keep track of pages.
  - Most pages should include the relevant tracking and analytics scripts/tags.
  - All pages should have links to support tracking and navigation.
